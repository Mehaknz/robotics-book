# Pitch Deck: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
*   **(Subtitle):** The University Capstone Course for Building the Future.
*   **(Your Name/Team Name)**
*   **(Logo/Hackathon Name)**

**Image Description:**
*   A stunning, high-impact image of a sleek, futuristic humanoid robot standing in a modern university lab, looking thoughtfully at a holographic interface. The image is bright, optimistic, and technologically advanced.

### **Slide 2: The Problem**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** The Massive Gap Between AI and the Real World
*   **1. The AI Talent Paradox:** Universities produce brilliant AI minds, but they can't interact with the physical world. They are experts in pixels, not atoms.
*   **2. The Robotics Barrier:** Robotics is hardware-heavy, notoriously difficult, and fragmented. Existing courses are too theoretical or focus on niche industrial arms, not general-purpose humanoids.
*   **3. The Industry's Desperate Need:** Companies like Tesla, Figure, and Agility are racing to build humanoid workforces but face a critical shortage of engineers who can bridge AI and robotics.

**Image Description:**
*   A split-screen image. On the left, a glowing, abstract neural network. On the right, a physical robot arm clumsily failing to pick up a cup. A prominent "gap" or chasm is visualized between the two halves.

### **Slide 3: The Solution**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** The First All-in-One Humanoid Robotics Course
*   **A 13-week, project-based capstone course that turns any AI student into a full-stack humanoid engineer.**
*   We provide the curriculum, the software stack, and the complete sim-to-real workflow.
*   **Our Philosophy:** "From Pixels to Actions." Learn by building a robot that understands language and acts in the physical world.

**Image Description:**
*   A clean, powerful graphic showing three icons flowing into each other:
    1.  A brain icon labeled "AI Theory."
    2.  A code icon labeled "ROS 2 + Isaac Sim."
    3.  A humanoid robot icon labeled "Real-World Action."
*   The overall image conveys a seamless pipeline.

### **Slide 4: The Curriculum: From Zero to Humanoid in 13 Weeks**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** A Project-Driven Journey
*   **Weeks 1-4: The Foundation:** Master ROS 2, Python, and build complex virtual worlds in NVIDIA's Isaac Sim.
*   **Weeks 5-9: The Intelligence:** Implement navigation and manipulation. Critically, integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to create a "brain" that translates natural language into robot actions.
*   **Weeks 10-13: The Real World:** Deploy the entire stack onto an NVIDIA Jetson, perform sim-to-real transfer, and command a physical humanoid robot with your voice.

**Image Description:**
*   A timeline graphic. A line progresses from left to right, with key project milestones marked on it. For example, a "waving robot" at Week 3, a "robot navigating a maze" at Week 6, and a "robot grasping a cup commanded by voice" at Week 9.

### **Slide 5: The Technology Stack**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** Built on Industry-Standard, Open-Source Power
*   **(Show Logos)**
*   **ROS 2:** The open-source operating system for all robotics.
*   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim:** For photorealistic, physics-accurate simulation. The gold standard for sim-to-real.
*   **NVIDIA Jetson:** For high-performance, low-power AI compute at the edge.
*   **OpenAI:** For cutting-edge Vision-Language-Action models (GPT-4o) and voice recognition (Whisper).

**Image Description:**
*   A "stack" diagram. Each technology is a layer in the stack, with prominent logos. At the bottom is Hardware (Jetson, Humanoid), then ROS 2, then Isaac Sim, and at the top, OpenAI models.

### **Slide 6: The DEMO: "Bring me the red cup."**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** Live Demo: From Voice to Action in 60 Seconds
*   **1. Command:** The user speaks a natural language command.
*   **2. Perceive:** Whisper transcribes the audio. The robot's camera identifies objects in the room.
*   **3. Understand:** GPT-4o receives the text and visual information, breaking the command down into a sequence of actions: `[NAVIGATE_TO_TABLE]`, `[IDENTIFY_RED_CUP]`, `[PICK_UP]`, `[RETURN]`.
*   **4. Act:** ROS 2 nodes execute the plan, controlling the humanoid's walking and manipulation in real-time.

**Image Description:**
*   A 4-panel comic strip showing the demo flow.
    1.  A person speaking into a mic.
    2.  A diagram showing text ("Bring me the red cup") and an image of the scene going into a GPT-4o logo.
    3.  A code snippet showing the action plan: `[NAVIGATE, PICK_UP, RETURN]`.
    4.  A photo of the humanoid robot grasping the red cup.

### **Slide 7: Market Opportunity & Business Model**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** Educating the Engineers for a Trillion-Dollar Market
*   **The Market:** The humanoid robotics market is projected to be the next major tech wave. The bottleneck isn't hardware; it's talent.
*   **Our Business Model: University Partnership**
    *   We license the complete course-in-a-box to universities for an annual fee per department.
    *   Includes: Curriculum, setup scripts, support, and access to our pre-trained models.
    *   **TAM:** 500+ top engineering universities worldwide.
    *   **SAM:** 100 universities with strong AI/robotics programs.

**Image Description:**
*   A graph showing the exponential growth curve of the projected humanoid robotics market. Superimposed on this graph are logos of top universities (MIT, Stanford, CMU, etc.), indicating them as customers.

### **Slide 8: Why Us? Why Now?**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** The Perfect Team at the Perfect Time
*   **The Convergence:** For the first time, three key technologies have matured simultaneously:
    1.  Capable Humanoid Hardware
    2.  Photorealistic Sim-to-Real Simulators (Isaac Sim)
    3.  Powerful Vision-Language-Action Models (GPT-4o)
*   **Our Team:** A unique blend of world-class AI researchers, veteran robotics engineers, and educators. We have already built and shipped complex robotic systems. We are the team to create the curriculum because we live it.

**Image Description:**
*   A dynamic image showing three intersecting circles, labeled "Hardware," "Simulation," and "AI." At the very center of the intersection, place your project logo. Add brief profile pictures and titles for team members.

### **Slide 9: The Ask**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** We're Asking for the Win to Accelerate Our Vision
*   **What We'll Do with the Prize:**
    *   **Finalize University Partner Program:** Onboard our first 3 pilot universities (partnerships already in discussion).
    *   **Open-Source the Core:** Release a "community edition" of the curriculum to build a massive user base and talent funnel.
    *   **Expand the Curriculum:** Develop advanced modules on multi-robot collaboration and complex assembly tasks.

**Image Description:**
*   A simple, bold slide with three icons representing the three goals:
    1.  A university building icon.
    2.  A GitHub (Octocat) icon.
    3.  A "V2.0" icon, suggesting the next version of the curriculum.

### **Slide 10: Thank You**

**Text:**
*   **(Title):** Let's Build the Future, Together.
*   **(Your Name)**
*   **(Email Address)**
*   **(Link to your GitHub/Project Page)**

**Image Description:**
*   The same powerful image from the title slide, but now the robot is looking directly at the camera, perhaps extending a hand. The feeling is one of invitation and readiness.
