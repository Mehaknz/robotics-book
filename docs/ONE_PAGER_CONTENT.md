**(Section 1: The Vision - Centered, Large Text)**

## Bridging the Gap Between AI and the Physical World

We created the world's first complete capstone course to train the full-stack robotics engineers who will build the future of intelligent, general-purpose humanoids.

| We use **OpenAI GPT-4o** as a Vision-Language-Action model. The robot sees, understands, and acts on natural voice commands from any user. This is a shift from rigid scripts to fluid, AI-driven reasoning. | Built on **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, we provide a photorealistic, physics-accurate environment for students to build, test, and iterate safely before deploying to expensive hardware. | The entire system is orchestrated by the **Robot Operating System (ROS 2)**, the industry-standard, open-source framework used to build real-world, production-grade robotic systems. |

### **Live Demo: From Voice to Action in 60 Seconds**

**(1) VOICE COMMAND**<br>
User: "Bring me the red cup."
`->`
**(2) AI UNDERSTANDING (GPT-4o)**<br>
Whisper API transcribes audio. GPT-4o sees the room and creates a plan: `[NAVIGATE, GRASP, RETURN]`.
`->`
**(3) ROS 2 EXECUTION**<br>
ROS 2 nodes for navigation and manipulation execute the plan in Isaac Sim.
`->`
**(4) TASK COMPLETE**<br>
The humanoid robot delivers the red cup.
