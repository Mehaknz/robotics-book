## 1. Hardware Cost Calculator (Per Student/Team)

This table provides an estimated cost breakdown for the physical hardware required to complete the "sim-to-real" portion of the course. The goal is to provide a clear, transparent budget for university departments.

*Note: Prices are estimates and can vary based on supplier and educational discounts.*

| Component | Item | Estimated Cost (USD) | Purpose | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Humanoid Robot** | Unitree H1 (or similar) | ~$90,000 | The core physical platform for the final project. | This is the most significant cost. Universities may use one robot per 2-3 student teams. Alternatives exist. |
| **Embedded Computer**| NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin Dev Kit| ~$2,000 | Onboard "brain" for the robot, running the full AI stack. | The Orin Nano (~$500) can be used for earlier, less intensive modules. |
| **Workstation** | Desktop PC with NVIDIA RTX 4090 | ~$4,000 | For running Isaac Sim and training/fine-tuning models. | A single powerful workstation can be shared among students. Many university labs already have these. |
| **Perception** | Intel RealSense D455 | ~$400 | Depth camera for robust 3D perception. | Often included with the humanoid platform, but listed for completeness. |
| **Networking** | High-speed Wi-Fi Router | ~$200 | Ensures low-latency communication between the robot and workstation. | A dedicated network is recommended for reliability. |
| **Miscellaneous** | Cables, Power Supplies, etc. | ~$150 | General supplies. | |
| **TOTAL (Low-End Estimate)** | **(1 Jetson Nano, Shared PC/Robot)** | **~$5,000 per team** | Assumes major hardware is a shared resource. | |
| **TOTAL (High-End Estimate)**| **(1 Jetson AGX, Dedicated PC, Shared Robot)**| **~$6,500 per team**| Assumes more dedicated resources per team. | |
| **TOTAL (Full Dedication)**| **(Full kit per team)** | **~$96,750 per team**| Unlikely scenario; for a fully-funded, dedicated lab per team. | |

**Subject: Proposal to Implement the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" Capstone Course**

Dear Dr. [Department Head Name],

The field of robotics is undergoing a paradigm shift, driven by breakthroughs in AI. Companies like Tesla, Figure, and Google DeepMind are no longer just dreaming of general-purpose humanoid robots; they are actively building and deploying them. This has created an unprecedented and urgent demand for a new kind of engineer—one who is fluent in both AI and full-stack robotics.

Currently, a significant gap exists in university curricula. While students excel in theoretical AI, they lack the hands-on, systems-level experience required to bring that intelligence into the physical world.

This is why we developed **"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics,"** the world's first comprehensive, 13-week capstone course designed to bridge this gap. Our turn-key curriculum transforms senior AI and CS students into job-ready, full-stack robotics engineers.

Our program offers:
*   **A Project-Based Curriculum:** A 13-week journey from ROS 2 fundamentals to deploying a complete AI stack on a physical humanoid robot.
*   **Industry-Standard Tooling:** Students master ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim for simulation, and NVIDIA Jetson for embedded computing—the same tools used by top robotics companies.
*   **Cutting-Edge AI Integration:** We are the first to build a curriculum around Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, allowing students to use models like GPT-4o to create a "brain" for the robot that understands natural language.

We provide a "course-in-a-box," including the full syllabus, all project code, setup scripts, and a detailed sim-to-real workflow. By adopting our curriculum, [University Name] would position itself as a global leader in robotics education, attracting top-tier students and preparing them for high-impact careers in this exploding industry.

We would be delighted to schedule a 30-minute meeting to present a live demo of our platform and discuss a pilot program for the upcoming academic year. We are confident that this partnership will be of immense value to your students and the university as a whole.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
