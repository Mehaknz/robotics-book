# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
Ensure technical accuracy through official documentation, primary sources, and validated references.

### Clarity for Technical Audience
Write with clarity for a technical audience (CS/Software Engineering background).

### Reproducibility
Every workflow, command, or code sample must be executable by the reader.

### Rigor
Prioritize peer-reviewed, authoritative, or official sources.

## Key Standards

- All factual/technical claims must be source-verified.
- Use APA citation style.
- At least 50% of all sources must be academic, peer-reviewed, or official technical documentation.
- Writing must be original: 0% plagiarism tolerance.
- Maintain Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12 readability.
- Structure content to be fully compatible with Docusaurus (Markdown, sidebars, frontmatter, etc.).

## Constraints

- Output: A complete technical book on AI-native software development and AI-assisted authoring.
- Word count: 20,000–30,000 total words (flexible per chapter).
- Minimum 25 high-quality sources.
- Formats: Markdown for Docusaurus; deploy via GitHub Pages.
- Must use Spec-Kit Plus for planning/spec creation and Claude Code for development.

## Success Criteria

- All claims verified with proper citations.
- Zero plagiarism.
- Docusaurus build succeeds without warnings or errors.
- GitHub Pages deployment functions correctly.
- All chapters follow Spec-Kit Plus workflow: constitution → vision → architecture → chapter specs → drafts → refinement.
- Book is clear, actionable, and reproducible for developers.

## Governance

This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and standards. Amendments require team consensus, documentation of changes, and a clear migration path for existing content. All contributions and reviews must adhere to these principles.
