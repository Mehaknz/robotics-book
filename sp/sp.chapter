## 5. Workflows and Activities

### 5.1. Activity 1: [Descriptive Title of the Activity]

*A step-by-step guide for a practical, hands-on lab exercise. Each step must be clear and verifiable.*

1.  **Step 1: Setup the Environment**
    - Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 workspace:
      ```bash
      source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
      ```
2.  **Step 2: Launch the Simulation**
    - Use the provided launch file to start the Gazebo simulation.
      ```bash
      ros2 launch my_robot_gazebo simulation.launch.py
      ```
3.  **Step 3: Run the Control Node**
    - In a second terminal, run the Python node you will write in this activity.
      ```bash
      ros2 run my_robot_control control_node
      ```
4.  **Expected Outcome**: The simulated robot in Gazebo should move forward 1 meter and then stop.

### 5.2. Reproducible Example: [Example Code Title]

*A self-contained code snippet demonstrating a key concept. The code must be complete, executable, and adhere to the project's constitution.*

```python
#
# File: /path/to/example_node.py
#
# Description: This script demonstrates a minimal ROS 2 publisher node
#              that sends velocity commands.
#
# To Run:
# 1. Ensure ROS 2 environment is sourced.
# 2. Execute with `python3 example_node.py`
#

import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

class MoveBot(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('move_bot_node')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(Twist, 'cmd_vel', 10)
        # ... implementation details ...

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    move_bot = MoveBot()
    # ... logic to run the node ...
    move_bot.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## 6. Assessments and Verification Criteria

*A checklist to verify that the chapter's objectives and lab activities have been successfully completed.*

-   [ ] **Verification 1**: The simulation environment launches without any fatal errors.
-   [ ] **Verification 2**: The ROS 2 control node compiles and runs successfully.
-   [ ] **Verification 3**: The robot's movement in the simulation matches the expected outcome described in Activity 1.
-   [ ] **Verification 4**: The student can correctly answer the following question: [Insert conceptual question here].

## 8. Notes and Warnings

*Important information, common pitfalls, and safety warnings.*

> **⚠️ Safety Warning:** When working with a physical robot, always ensure the emergency stop is accessible. Never run untested code that generates physical motion without supervision.

> **💡 Technical Note:** If you encounter a `colcon build` failure, first try deleting the `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` directories before rebuilding.
